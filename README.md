# Texel

Over 20 years ago I wrote a spreadsheet application called ["Texel"](https://snailshell.de/Texel/) for Atari/TOS/MagiC systems. From time to time I'm being asked if I could release the Texel source code... Well, here it is.

## Disclaimer

This source code is completely out of date. It is provided as-is without any warranty.

I publish the source files for historical / archaeological reasons only, for informational purposes.
The code is not intended to be used any more, especially not as a template for new code.

## Please note

Texel was built using Pure Pascal (an Object Pascal dialect for Atari/TOS/MagiC systems).
I don't think it will compile any more, because I used a special version of the Pure Pascal compiler
that allowed for a larger virtual method table (VMT) than the compiler version that was publicly available.
I don't think the necessary compiler binary was ever made public &ndash; but please prove me wrong!

Some parts of the code (some class names, some variables) and most of the documentation
are in Germany only. Sorry for that.

And remember, the code you'll see does not represent the way software should be written and built today.
I would not want to write files with 20000 lines or more nowadays (it was a bad idea even in the last millenium).
And I definitely would not want to work without automated unit tests. But heck, those were the times...

Have fun! :-)
